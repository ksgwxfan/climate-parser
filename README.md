# Climate Parser v1.4
A Python Script enabling extensive analysis of climate data for individual cities in the United States

### Introduction
Weather data are faithfully kept, recorded, and preserved everyday. This is primarily done via assistance of weather-stations which are plentiful and scattered about all over the United States. This script allows the user to analyze downloaded CSV files that contain land-based station data. Within seconds, the user can retrieve daily, weekly, monthly, annual, and even climatological data, including ranking the data.
